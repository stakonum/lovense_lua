# LovenseLUA BETA
LovenseLUA allows you to control your Lovense toy in GTA V, using the Stand mod menu.  
The script allows you to not only control your toy as you can in the "remote" app, but also allows you to set it to react to in-game events, define and play custom patterns, adjust nearly every aspect of the command, allow players to send commands to it via chat commands, and much, much more.  
It also supports multiple toys, and seamlessly connects to every single one.  
  
# Beta  
This script is currently in BETA. As such, EXPECT BUGS, and to help out, PLEASE REPORT THEM!!!
  
## Install
Download the repo as zip and drag everything from it, except readme.md and license.txt, into your Stand's lua scripts folder. Done.  
Bug reports and suggestions should go into the Discord (there is a button in the script menu to access it).  
  
# Usage  
Please highlight the "hover over for help" action in the Lua for information on setup. Basically you want to download the "Lovense Connect" app on your phone and connect the toy to it, then connect your phone to the same network as your PC.  
VPN's and other network-affecting tools and utilities may prevent a proper connection.
